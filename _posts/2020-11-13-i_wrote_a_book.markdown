I have written a book called **Build Engineering Applications using Python and Flask**. 

The book starts from the very fundamentals of creating HTML web pages, and then gradually introduces Flask fundamentals to the reader in order to make elegant, functional engineering applications that work online.

Further, the book shows step by step process of reading data from forms, text files and spreadsheets.

The book also reviews simple optimisation techniques that might be required for engineers from time to time, and curve fitting techniques that may be required to process curve data for use in engineering purposes.

Access to code written for the examples in the book can be requested using links printed inside the book.

In 2019, I worked on creating a fatigue calculation app at work that was made available to all my colleagues at work. The process of creating the app using Python and Flask involved a lot of searching around the internet for introducing features inside the app.

To have a record of all these learnings for future work, and to have a ready reference, I decided to document them systematically. This grew into an idea of converting it into a well laid out book, so that engineers like me can go step by step and convert their Python code to a Flask app, that can then be demostrated to everyone using services like Heroku and Pythonanywhere.

I am sure this book will help engineers like me out there to quickly create engineering applications and share them with friends and colleagues.

The book can be purchased on Amazon Kindle using the below links:

From India: [Click here to buy on amazon.in](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B08NF2R4GF/ref=sr_1_6?dchild=1&keywords=build+engineering+applications&qid=1605250772&sr=8-6).

From USA: [Click here to buy on amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08NF2R4GF/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=build+engineering+applications+using+python+and+flask&qid=1605251594&sr=8-1).

I am happy that I could publish this book online on the auspicious day of [Dhanteras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhanteras).

Happy Diwali to all!
