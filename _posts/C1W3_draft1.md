# Introduction to Probability and Data

## Week 3: a. Defining Probability

### Introduction

- Random Process: In a random process, we know what outcomes could happen, but we don't know which particular outcome will happen.

- Probability: P(A) = Probability: There are several possible interpretations of probability, but they (almost) completely agree on the mathematical rules probability must follow.
0 <= P(A) <= 1

- Frequentist interpretation: The probability of an outcome is the proportion of times the outcome would occur if we observed the random process an infinite number of times.

- Bayesian interpretation: A Bayesian interprets probability as a subjective degree of belief. Largerly popularised by revolutionary advance in computational technology and methods during the last twenty years.

- Law of large numbers: states that as more observations are collected, the proportion of occurrences with a particular outcome converges to the probability of that outcome.
