## Week 2: a. Exploring Numerical Data


#### Visualising Numerical Data:

a. Scatter Plots: Usually Exploratory variables are plotted on x-axes and response variables are plotted on y-axes. But this does not mean that relationship between the two is causal [correlation does not imply causation].

Evaluating a relationship:
1. Direction: Positive or Negative
2. Shape: Linear or Curved
3. Strength: Strong (low scatter) or weak (high scatter)
4. Outliers: Individual outliers - individual outliers or group of observations

b. Histograms: 
  - provides view of the data density
  - especially useful for describing the shape of distribution
    - Left Skewed or Right Skewed.
