# Introduction to Probability and Data

## Week 2: a. Exploring Numerical Data

### Visualising Numerical Data:

a. Scatter Plots: Usually Exploratory variables are plotted on x-axes and response variables are plotted on y-axes. But this does not mean that relationship between the two is causal [correlation does not imply causation].

Evaluating a relationship:
1. Direction: Positive or Negative
2. Shape: Linear or Curved
3. Strength: Strong (low scatter) or weak (high scatter)
4. Outliers: Individual outliers - individual outliers or group of observations

b. Histograms: 
  - provides view of the data density
  - especially useful for describing the shape of distribution
    - Symmetric, Left Skewed (long tail on left) or Right Skewed (long tail on right).
  - Modality:
    - Unimodal (single prominent peak), Bimodal (two peaks), uniform (i would call it plateau) or multimodal (many peaks).
  - Histogram and bin width:
    - Too wide a bin width can cause some data to not get visualised, too narrow a bin width can make it difficult to get an overall picture of the distribution. Ideal bin width depends on the data - so some iteration is required before a proper bin width that tells the story appropriately is achieved.

c. Dotplot:
  - useful when individual values are of interest
  - can get busy as the sample size increases

d. Box plot:
  - used for highlighting outliers, median, IQR.
  
e. Intensity map:
  - useful for highlighting spatial distribution

### Measures of Center:
Commonly used measures of center:
- Mean: arithmetic average
- Median: midpoint of distribution (50th percentile)
- Mode: most frequent observation

Skewness vs. Measures of Center:
- Left skewed: mean < median
- Symmetric: mean ~ median
- Right skewed: mean > media
