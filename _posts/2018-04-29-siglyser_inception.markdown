I had been tinkering around the idea of making an open source signal processing application for a long time. I started building SigLyser around Scilab in 2014. After creating a basic GUI - I found Scilab lacking to handle the data structure and also the GUI making part. After learning Python - I found it a better candidateÂ  and decided to move SigLyser to Python.

SigLyser will be built as a web application - using Flask.

Initial data reading using Pandas. Further - converted to NumPy arrays.

The signal processing calculations will be done the the SciPy modules of fftpack and signal.

Plotting is done using the Bokeh library.

Code repository: https://github.com/siglyser/siglyser

Code Running: https://siglyser.herokuapp.com/

Project page: https://siglyser.github.io

The project is at a very early stage - I will start looking for contributors once the project reaches a certain stage.

Update on 09 June 2019:
Still haven't progressed much beyond the initial release. Have to pickup on all projects as time permits.
