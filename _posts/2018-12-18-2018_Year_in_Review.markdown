2018 has been a very busy year. Below is a month wise summary:

February: I became a father

May: (re)Started my Machine Learning Journey by starting Neural Networks. Thanks to @teoliphant

June: Neural Networks and Deep Learning [DeepLearning.ai] [Coursera]

July: Improving Deep Neural Networks, Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimisation [Coursera]

August: Data Scientist with Python Track [DataCamp.com]
        Convolution Neural Networks [Coursera]

November: GE Analytics Engineer Certification completion,
	    	  GE Hackathon [my first Machine Learning hackathon participation]

December: Probability and Statistics [in-progress] [Stanford Lagunita]
          Statistical Learning [planned] [Stanford Lagunita]

I came across many statistical terms and fundamentals whilst working on the Analytics Engineer certification and whilst participating in the hackathon - the December schedule are to cover those fundamentals that were missing from the previous courses - the Stanford Lagunita course - covers them in good depth.



## Plan for 2019:

1. Time series Analysis and Prediction

2. Sequence Models - This course is very heavy with fundamentals and programming - I did start in December - but wanted to keep the month lighter and catch up on some missing things.

3. Build systems around neural networks for application in Mechanical Engineering.

4. Continue work on the signal processing application
