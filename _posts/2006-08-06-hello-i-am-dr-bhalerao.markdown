This is not my family doctors style of greeting. Dr. Bhalerao is a character in a movie called Bluffmaster. Agreed that it was a fake name in the movie itself, created for the storyline, who actually turned out to be an animal doctor at the end, Boman Irani (awesome artist) is the actor who played the role....but he did have its own emotional set of dialogues, which touched my heart. here is the story by him (nicely narrated by him, realistic) which made the impact:



"My father bought me a new bicycle and I was really scared to ride it, as it was the first time. I told my father to hold it from behind and kinda run behind me. Dad assured me that he was there behind, and i went faster and faster. Again and again i kept on telling him not to leave the cycle, after some time I found Dad away from me, waving, smiling. I LEARNT TO RIDE A CYCLE, ROY.........,I LEARNT TO RIDE A CYCLE.......". (Roy is the person to whom Dr Bhalerao is narrating the story).



Well this was the same thing which happened to me a ten years back or so. Dad and I went to the play ground near by, where one of my friends was riding his new bicycle. I asked him if i could try once and he agreed, rest is the same as Boman described, same manner. I think this happens in almost every ones lives, in a similar manner, be it a cycle, or any thing. Just wanted to write about it. Bye.
