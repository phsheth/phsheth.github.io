Introduction to Probability and Data

Week 1: Designing Studies

Data Basics:

Types of variables:</br>

a. Numerical (Quantitative): 
These are values collected over time and can be added, subtracted, averaged. Examples: Temperature or pressure readings. Stock market prices, etc. They can be sub-categorised as: </br>
   - Continuous: Infinite number of values in a given range </br>
   - Discreet: Specific set of numeric values. </br>
   
b. Categorical (Qualitative): These can be ratings or levels. Arithmetic operations are not possible of these. They can be sub-categorised as: </br>
   - Nominal (regular categorical): These are unordered categorical. Example: what do you prefer for dessert: icecream or jelly. Or are you morning person or afternoon person. </br>
   - Ordinal (ordered categorical): These are ordered ratings. Example: High/Medium/Low, etc. </br>

Types of Studies:</br>

a. Observational:</br>
   - Collect data so that the subjects/machines are not interfered with (and do not know that they are being observed)</br>
   - Only establish correlation</br>
   - Uses past data only.</br>
   - data are collected throught out the study</br>
   
b. Experimental:<br>
   - randomly assign subjects to groups (for different treatments)</br>
   - establish causation</br>

Example:</br>
- Two groups of people that does work out and does not is studied. each group's average energy level is calculated.</br>
- A set of people is split into two groups randomly and one groups is made to work out, and other is not.</br>
- The difference here is - for the first two groups - it is left to the people to work out, whereas for the second set - they decision to work out or not is imposed.</br>
- Average energy levels are compared.</br>
     
Confounding variables:</br>
Extraneous variables that affect both the explanatory and the response variable, and that make it seem like there is a relationship betwee them are called confounding variables.</br>
    
"Correlation does not imply causation" </br>
    
![Correlation](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/correlation.png)

Correlation doesn't imply causation, but it does waggle its eyebrows suggestively and gesture furtively while mouthing 'look over there'.</br>

Sampling and sources of bias:

Sampling: When we decide to test a group - isn't it better to include the entire population in the sample? i.e. conduct a census? This is not possible every time as:
- some individuals are hard to locate and might have a different opinion than others
- population is mobile and do not stay in one place.

Hence - sampling is favoured. The lecturer compares sampling to tasting the food whilst cooking. To establish that the food is cooked properly - the entire cauldron of stew need not be eaten to determine that - the stew is mixed well and a small quantity (spoonful) - representative sample - the taste (inference) of this spoonful is generalised over the entire sample of stew. If the stew is tasted without mixing - the water at the top will be less tastier than the thick stew at the bottom.

Sources of Sampling Bias:
- Convenience Sample: Easily accessible individuals are more likely to be included in the sample
- Non-response: Only randomly sampled people respond to the survey, which are no longer representative of the entire population
- Voluntary response: Sample consists of people who volunteer to respond because they have a strong opinion on the issue.
