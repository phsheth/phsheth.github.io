Introduction to Probability and Data

Week 1

Data Basics:

Types of variables:</br>
    a.  Numerical (Quantitative): These are values collected over time and can be added, subtracted, averaged. Examples: Temperature or pressure readings. Stock market prices, etc. They can be sub-categorised as: </br>
        -   Continuous: Infinite number of values in a given range </br>
        -   Discreet: Specific set of numeric values. </br>
    b.  Categorical (Qualitative): These can be ratings or levels. Arithmetic operations are not possible of these. They can be sub-categorised as: </br>
        -   Nominal (regular categorical): These are unordered categorical. Example: what do you prefer for dessert: icecream or jelly. Or are you morning person or afternoon person. </br>
        -   Ordinal (ordered categorical): These are ordered ratings. Example: High/Medium/Low, etc. </br>

Types of Studies:</br>
    a.  Observational:</br>
        -   Collect data so that the subjects/machines are not interfered with (and do not know that they are being observed)</br>
        -   Only establish correlation</br>
        -   Uses past data only.</br>
        -   data are collected throught out the study</br>
    b. Experimental:<br>
        -   randomly assign subjects to groups (for different treatments)</br>
        -   establish causation</br>

Example:</br>
    Two groups of people that does work out and does not is studied. each group's average energy level is calculated.</br>
    A set of people is split into two groups randomly and one groups is made to work out, and other is not.</br>
     The difference here is - for the first two groups - it is left to the people to work out, whereas for the second set - they decision to work out or not is imposed.</br>
     Average energy levels are compared.</br>
     
Confounding variables:</br>
    Extraneous variables that affect both the explanatory and the response variable, and that make it seem like there is a relationship betwee them are called confounding variables.</br>
    
"Correlation does not imply causation" </br>
    
![Correlation](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/correlation.png)

Correlation doesn't imply causation, but it does waggle its eyebrows suggestively and gesture furtively while mouthing 'look over there'.</br>
