So, there have been many bar chart race [BCR henceforth] visualisations around on the internet. The latest one was used by Formula 1 to show driver positions and visualising the entire race on a bar chart. BCRs are pretty cool. They are animated, and show the position, and progress dynamically.

In this part - I will use the easiest method to create a bar chart race - [Flourish!](https://app.flourish.studio)

Using [Flourish!](https://app.flourish.studio) is pretty nifty. But, it is better to clean and prepare the data outside to be conducive to the [Flourish!](https://app.flourish.studio) environment.

The data we will look to convert to a BCR is from Wikipedia: [List of countries by motor vehicle production!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_motor_vehicle_production)
